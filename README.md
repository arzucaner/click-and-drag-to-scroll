# Click and Drag to Scroll

This is a project that allows you to click and drag to scroll through a section of content. This project was completed as a part of the JavaScript 30 Challenge by Wes Bos. The original idea and starter code was provided by Wes Bos.

## How it Works

When you click on the section and start dragging, the mousedown event is fired and the isDown flag is set to true.
As long as the isDown flag is true, the mousemove event is fired, and the scrollLeft property of the section is updated based on the distance between the current and previous mouse positions.
When the mouse button is released, the mouseup event is fired and the isDown flag is set to false.
